### Gabriel Palhares 

**Hi, my name is Gabriel,** also known as **minortypo.** I am a brazilian software engineer and a lifelong computer science student.

**I enjoy what I do,** and I love getting better at what I do. I work on providing solutions in both frontend and backend development, using technologies such as Typescript, React, Node.js, and Go.
