### Hi, my name is Gabriel

I am a brazilian software engineer and a lifelong computer science student.
I work on providing solutions in both frontend and backend development, using technologies such as Typescript, React, Node.js and Go.
When I'm not coding, you'll find me enjoying mountain biking and living an outdoor lifestyle.
