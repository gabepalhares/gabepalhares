#### Gabriel Palhares

I am a brazilian full stack developer and a lifelong computer science student.
I work on providing solutions in both frontend and backend development, using technologies such as JavaScript, TypeScript, React.js and Node.js.
When I'm not coding, you'll find me enjoying mountain biking and living an outdoor lifestyle: collecting sunsets and exploring nature.

Inspired by the idea of the Zettelkasten method, I am building <a href="https://gabrielpalhares.dev/gbunker/">G-Bunker</a>, a way to centralize and share everything I am learning.
Sometimes, I do some code challenges on <a href="https://leetcode.com/gabriel-palhares/">LeetCode</a> and also write <a href="https://dev.to/gabriel-palhares">articles</a> about technology. I have a blog called <a href="https://gabrielpalhares.dev/techtrails">Tech Trails</a>.

You can reach out to me via LinkedIn or my professional e-mail.
